# Gould's

[Gould’s Sugarhouse](http://www.goulds-sugarhouse.com/) is an institution. It’s big, easy-to-find, and people come from all over. Everyone warned us about the lines, but veterans of Honey’s Sit ‘n Eat are not deterred by a pancake line. Oh no. Gould’s is definitely on the “less shacky” side of the sugar house spectrum–they even have real placemats and silverware.

Notice the pickles, which act as a sour counterpart to the sweet syrup.

Best thing about Gould’s: pickles!
